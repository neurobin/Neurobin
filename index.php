						<b id="first_letter">T</b>here's nothing more intriguing or more interesting than exploring the Unknown.<q>The Unknown?</q>, yes, there's so much more to know, that whatever direction
						you may look, you can only see the ignorance of your poor self. And somewhere there, is a whole universe, yeah, a whole universe, different than the one
						we live in and know about, waiting patiently, for eternity, for humans to step in and explore. But the thing is, only humans with certain amount
						of intelligence and certain types of instruments, can enter into that universe and play around with it's resources. And to top it off, this universe
						has an unlimited supply of resources which is supposed to never end, and that is somewhat unbelievable.
					</p>
					<p>
						Really? is there something that is actually infinite? To answer that question, I should say <q>yes</q>. The universe I am talking about, I call it <q>The
							Binary Universe</q>. Yap, it's made of binary digits. Now questions may arise, <q>can just two digits make a whole universe? you could say a world, but
							even that would be exaggerating.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						Nope, you are wrong, It's really a whole universe, an infinite one, one with galaxies containing numerous planets in it. It's so gigantic that
						people have never been able to find  any or even dreamt of how might it be in the galaxies other than the native one. Yes, there's a native
						galaxy out there, just like our long known <q>The Milky Way</q>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The terminologies and names of the members/particles of this universe are quite different than the one we live in. The basic particle is known as
						digits, basically 1 and 0. A massive amount of this digits once formed into the sky of this new universe and it went into a gaseous state and
						started reacting with each other and began self compression. This self compression was so powerful that the whole mass of digits came into a
						single unit which I call a singularity digit. The definition of this primitive digit is unknown, because it defies every definition we have about
						digits and stuff. But the next thing you know, it exploded, a historical explosion, at the beginning of the Binary Universe when time itself started
						for this new creation.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what happened after the explosion? Let's see, oh yeah, it made galaxies, and then planets hanging onto those galaxies. And those planets, soon they
						started showing life signs on them. <q>Life signs? you mean people?</q>, no, certainly not. Those are what we call <q>Softwares</q> now a days.
						"You must be joking right?" No, again, I am not. They are living things: they can be created, killed, injured, diseased, get old, even born. And top of
						that they can grow, expand, talk, walk, run, sit and even they can eat or get eaten. They can be stupid, clever, cunning, intelligent and
						they can be fooled or be deceived. They have quarrels with each other sometimes and engage on wars if needed. They can work and get tired if it's
						too much. After all this, can you say that they aren't life? Of course they aren't as lively as we humans are, but still they are the basic life force
						of the Binary Universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, these inhabitants live in groups or solo, in a continent, in a country. <q>Continent? Country?</q> Yap, for example, C, C++, Java are each a
						different country. And a continent is what we know as a Operating System. A Continent or Operating System is made of or contains a bunch of
						countries. In Binary Universe lexicon, we call the countries as programming languages, and the continents as Operating Systems or Systems as shorthand.
						And The Binary Universe, let's call it  "The Binary Macrocosm (BM)", it sounds kinda cool.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, in BM lexicon, houses, buildings or such things are known as disks or drives, rooms are known as sectors, company is unchanged i.e company
						is company. The inhabitants i.e softwares work on different joint or solo companies or organizations to earn there livings. You might be wondering
						what might there livings be? certainly, it's not money, it's <q>fame or honor</q>. Yeah, they can live as long as they are famous or at least hold good in
						front of others. They can eat but that's not necessary for there existence, what's necessary is the "fame" they earn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>That's good to know, but how do we explore it? Every single inhabitant is made of binary digits!</q>. As I said earlier, all you need to have is a
						certain amount of knowledge and a certain types of instrument. The requirement of knowledge is fulfilled if you have at least a little knowledge
						of programming i.e a little knowledge about at least one of the countries in our native planet in BM. In BM lexicon, country is language. So you
						need to know one of the languages and then you can start. The instruments are known as <q>Computers</q>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>What can You do if you know a language?</q>
						<br  />
						That will be the starting point of your sacred journey to the exploration of <q>The Great BM</q>. You can start by creating some new inhabitants of your
						own and to serve you or work under you and help you finding resources and fun in this new world. And as the word <q>company</q> of human world
						and in BM is identical, they are mutable, i.e you can earn money and get rich in real life by making your creation (inhabitants) to work in different
						companies in BM. But let's not look it like that. There's pure bliss in creating something new, you need to feel that, otherwise there's no point
						in exploring.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, What's your opinion? Are you ready for the ride?
						<br />
						Best of luck and hearty blessings to all...
